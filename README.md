# Workshop 2

Go to `Guide.md`
- Implement simple (logical) combinational functions, along with a testbench
- Implement an ALU that computes those functions
- Implement a simple control FSM which takes in an instruction register
and runs a decode and execute stage on any of the possible instruction opcodes
